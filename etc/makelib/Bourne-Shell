  Bourne Shell Constructs
     To use the Bourne shell if control structure for  branching,
     use a command line of the form:

          if expression ; \
          then command ; \
               ... ; \
          else command ; \
               ... ; \
          fi

     Although composed of several input lines, the  escaped  NEW-
     LINE  characters  insure  that  make  treats them all as one
     (shell) command line.

     To use the Bourne shell for control structure for loops, use
     a command line of the form:

          for var in list ; \
               do command; \
               ... ; \
          done

     To refer to a shell variable, use a double-dollar-sign ($$).
     This prevents expansion of the dollar-sign by make.
