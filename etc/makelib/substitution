  Suffix Replacement Macro References
     Substitutions within macros can be made as follows:

          $(name:string1=string2)

     where string1 is either a suffix, or a word to  be  replaced
     in the macro definition, and string2 is the replacement suf-
     fix or word.  Words in a macro value are separated by SPACE,
     TAB, and escaped NEWLINE characters.

  Pattern Replacement Macro References
     Pattern matching replacements can also be applied to macros,
     with a reference of the form:

          $(name:  op%os= np%ns)

     where op is the existing (old) prefix and os is the existing
     (old)  suffix,  np and ns are the new prefix and new suffix,
     respectively, and the pattern matched by % (a string of zero
     or more characters), is carried forward from the value being
     replaced.  For example:

          PROGRAM=fabricate
          DEBUG= $(PROGRAM:%=tmp/%-g)

     sets the value of DEBUG to tmp/fabricate-g.

     Note that pattern replacement  macro  references  cannot  be
     used  in the dependency list of a pattern matching rule; the
     % characters are not  evaluated  independently.   Also,  any
     number of % metacharacters can appear after the equal-sign.
