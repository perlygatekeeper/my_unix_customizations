NAME
     IPC::Semaphore - SysV Semaphore IPC object class

SYNOPSIS
         use IPC::SysV qw(IPC_PRIVATE S_IRWXU IPC_CREAT);
         use IPC::Semaphore;

         $sem = new IPC::Semaphore(IPC_PRIVATE, 10, S_IRWXU | IPC_CREAT);

         $sem->setall( (0) x 10);

         @sem = $sem->getall;

         $ncnt = $sem->getncnt;

         $zcnt = $sem->getzcnt;

         $ds = $sem->stat;

         $sem->remove;

DESCRIPTION
METHODS
     new ( KEY , NSEMS , FLAGS )
         Create a new semaphore set associated with KEY. NSEMS is
         the number of semaphores in the set. A new set is
         created if

     +       KEY is equal to IPC_PRIVATE

     +       KEY does not already  have  a  semaphore  identifier
             associated with it, and FLAGS & IPC_CREAT is true.

             On creation of a new semaphore set FLAGS is used to
             set the permissions.

     getall
         Returns the values of the semaphore set as an array.

     getncnt ( SEM )
         Returns the number of processes waiting for the
         semaphore SEM to become greater than it's current value

     getpid ( SEM )
         Returns the process id of the last process that
         performed an operation on the semaphore SEM.

     getval ( SEM )
         Returns the current value of the semaphore SEM.

     getzcnt ( SEM )
         Returns the number of processed waiting for the
         semaphore SEM to become zero.

     id  Returns the system identifier for the semaphore set.

     op ( OPLIST )
         OPLIST is a list of operations to pass to semop. OPLIST
         is a concatenation of smaller lists, each which has
         three values. The first is the semaphore number, the
         second is the operation and the last is a flags value.
         See the semop manpage for more details. For example

             $sem->op(
                 0, -1, IPC_NOWAIT,
                 1,  1, IPC_NOWAIT
             );

     remove
         Remove and destroy the semaphore set from the system.

     set ( STAT )

     set ( NAME => VALUE [, NAME => VALUE ...] )
         set will set the following values of the stat structure
         associated with the semaphore set.

             uid
             gid
             mode (oly the permission bits)

         set accepts either a stat object, as returned by the
         stat method, or a list of name-value pairs.

     setall ( VALUES )
         Sets all values in the semaphore set to those given on
         the VALUES list.  VALUES must contain the correct number
         of values.

     setval ( N , VALUE )
         Set the Nth value in the semaphore set to VALUE

     stat
         Returns an object of type IPC::Semaphore::stat which is
         a sub-class of Class::Struct. It provides the following
         fields. For a description of these fields see you system
         documentation.
