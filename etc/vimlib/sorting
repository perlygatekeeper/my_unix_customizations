:[range]sor[t][!] [i][u][r][n][x][o] [/{pattern}/]

[range]   - sort [range] lines (all lines if no [range]
!         - reverse
{pattern} - ignore parts of lines matching {pattern}
            lines not matching {pattern} do not get sorted.
r         - sort based on parts of line MATCHING {pattern} instead of
            parts NOT MATCHING {pattern}
i         - case-insensative sort
u         - unique
n         - decimal
o         - octal
x         - hexidecimal



For example, to sort on the second comma-separated field:

:sort /[^,]*,/

To sort on the text at virtual column 10 (thus ignoring the difference between
tabs and spaces):

:sort /.*\%10v/

To sort on the first number in the line, no matter what is in front of it:

:sort /.\{-}\ze\d/

(Explanation: ".\{-}" matches any text, "\ze" sets the end of the match and \d
matches a digit.) With [r] sorting is done on the matching {pattern} instead of
skipping past it as described above.

For example, to sort on only the first three letters of each line:

:sort /\a\a\a/ r
