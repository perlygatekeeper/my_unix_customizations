http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Use_Ctrl-O_instead_of_Esc_in_insert_mode_mappings

In insert mode, pressing Ctrl-O switches to normal mode for one command,
then switches back to insert mode when the command is finished.

For example, do not write mappings like this:

:imap <F5> <Esc>:set number!<CR>a
Instead, use:

:imap <F5> <C-o>:set number!<CR>
