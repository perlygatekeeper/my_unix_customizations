*loremipsum.txt*    A dummy text generator
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

Insert a dummy text of a certain length. Actually, the text isn't 
generated but selected from some text. By default, the following text is 
used, which is included in the archive:
http://www.lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet.com/lorem-ipsum-dolor-sit-amet.html

NOTE: The webpage didn't contain any copyright message but there is a 
statement that one should copy & paste the text. I thus assume it's ok 
to include it in the archive. If not, please let me know.
