*linglang.txt*      Perform actions on basis of the current line's language
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

The command |:Linglang| installs a buffer-local autocommand that checks 
the current line's language. I.e. enabling linglang for the current 
buffer won't affect other buffers. If the language of the line under the 
cursor changes, a user-defined action (e.g., set spelllang) will be 
executed.

:Linglang[!] [LANGS ...]
    Toggle linglang support for the current buffer.
    With [!], suppress message.

Currently supported:
- English
- German

In order to add a new language, you'll have to come up with some good 
words/regexps to identify it.

                                                    *linglang-data*
Language data is stored in .../autoload/linglang/LANGUAGE.ENCODING
The fileformat is simple:

- one word per line (these will be matched against word borders)
- arbitrary regular expressions: /REGEXP/

The pattern for the words and the regexps will be joined with \| (see 
|/bar|).
