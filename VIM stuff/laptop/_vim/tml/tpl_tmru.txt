*tmru.txt*  Most Recently Used Files
            Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This plugin provides a simple most recently files facility.

It was originally rather a by-product of tlib (vimscript #1863) and uses 
its tlib#input#List() function. This function allows quickly selecting a 
buffer by typing some part of the name (which will actually filter the 
list until only one item is left), the number, or by clicking with the 
mouse on the entry.

:TRecentlyUsedFiles ... open one or more recently used file(s)

If the 'viminfo' option contains !, then viminfo will be used to save 
the filelist. Otherwise the list will be saved in 
~/viminfo/cache/tmru/files.

By default tmru matches the search pattern on the full filename. If 
you want to match on the basename, add the following to 
~/vimfiles/after/plugin/tmru.vim: >

    let g:tmru_world.filter_format = 'fnamemodify(%%s, ":t")'

See :help vimball for details. If you have difficulties or use vim 7.0, 
please make sure, you have the current version of vimball
(vimscript #1502) installed or update your runtime.

This script requires tlib (vimscript #1863) to be installed.
