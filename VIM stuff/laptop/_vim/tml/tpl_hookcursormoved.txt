*hookcursormoved.txt*  Call functions when the cursor position changed
                       Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This experimental plugin provides some help with the definition of 
functions that should be called when the cursor position changed.

When the cursor position changes, it first checks if a certain condition 
is met and then calls functions registered in 
b:hookcursormoved_{MODE}_{CONDITION} (an array).

In order to define new conditions, you have to set the variable  
"g:hookcursormoved_{CONDITION}" to a function name (STRING). This 
function takes the current mode (i .. insert mode; n ... normal mode) 
as single argument.

Functions are best registered using |hookcursormoved#Register()|.
Example: >

    function! WhatsGoingOn(mode) "{{{3
        if mode == 'i'
            DoThis
        elseif mode == 'n'
            DoThat
        endif
    endf

    call hookcursormoved#Register('syntaxchange', function('WhatsGoingOn'))
