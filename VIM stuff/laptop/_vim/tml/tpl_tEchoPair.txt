*tEchoPair.txt*     Display matching parenthesis in the echo area
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

VIM is an excellent editor but in comparison too e.g. emacs it lacks a 
minor feature that makes editing lisp code somewhat cumbersome. While 
VIM can highlight the matching parenthesis, this doesn't help much with 
long functions when the matching parenthesis is off the screen. 
Emacs users are better off in such a situation, since emace displays the 
matching line in the echo area.

This plugin tries to mimic Emacs's behaviour. Whenever the cursor is 
placed over a parenthesis or an element of a pair the matching element 
is displayed in the echo area. If 'cmdheight' is set to a value greater 
than 1, additional context lines are displayed, too.


In order to enable this plugin, you choose between the following  
options:

    TEchoPairInstallBuffer ... enable for the current buffer

    call techopair#Install('*') ... enable globally

    let g:tEchoPairInstall = ['lisp', 'scheme'] ... enable for certain 
      filetypes


Currently, there are the following display modes:

    indicate ... Display the whole line and highlight the matching 
      parenthesis. If 'cmdheight' is greater than 1, additional lines 
      are display.

    inner ... Display the inner text Emacs-style.

In order to see the matching parenthesis when 'showmode' is on, set 
'cmdheight' to something greater than 1.

You can select the preferred display mode on a filetype basis, by 
setting g:tEchoPairStyle_{STYLE}.

Example: >

    let g:tEchoPairStyle_inner = ['lisp', 'scheme']
    let g:tEchoPairStyle_indicate = ['java']


The pairs are usually deduced from the value of 'matchpairs' unless 
there is an entry for the current buffer's filetype in g:tEchoPairs. For 
the following filetypes custom pairs are pre-defined:

    - ruby
    - vim
