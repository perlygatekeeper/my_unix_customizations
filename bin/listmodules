I recently found it necessary to list all installed Perl modules on one of my linux servers.
I wouldn't have thought that it would be as big a deal as it turned out to be.
After two hours or so of testing 20 or so methods google found for me, I settled
on the following 2.

From the command line:

perl -MFile::Find=find -MFile::Spec::Functions -Tlwe \
'find { wanted => sub { print canonpath $_ if /\.pm\z/ }, no_chdir => 1 }, @INC'

From a web page (CGI or Modperl/Mason):

list_modules.pl
